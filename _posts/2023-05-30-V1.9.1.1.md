As always, a new release seems to bring some new and interesting bugs, as well as locating older ones :(
This release should fix OpenBVE failing to start on systems requiring the GL3 menu (Primarily newer versions of OS-X)

### Significant Changes:
* Fix: OpenBVE failed to launch with the GL3 menu due to a train plugin interface change.
* Fix: Incorrect texture caching access for trains with nighttime textures.
* Fix: Issue using the Windscreen section later in a Panel2
* Change: Remove various bits of older BVE2 hacks related code from the PanelXML parser- This should have no effect on user content.
