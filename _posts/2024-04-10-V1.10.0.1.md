This is a quick patch release, primarily to address a couple of issues which were inevitably identified just after I'd pushed v1.10.0.0

### Significant Changes:
* New: Add the **PlayerPath** command to allow for non-changeable switches.
* New: TFOs are checked when considering the nearest train.
* Change: Add *CTRL + F9* as the default key for **SWITCH_CHANGE** (existing installs will need to set this key manually, or reset the controls to default)
* Fix: Touch commands containing an underscore were broken in v1.9.2.5 by the language file refactor.
