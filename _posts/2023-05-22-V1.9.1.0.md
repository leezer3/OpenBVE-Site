This release of OpenBVE introduces the next stage of moving the sim away from a purely linear, forwards-facing world- The ability to drive an existing routefile in the opposite direction.

For the moment, if you wish to take advantage of this experimental feature, this must be set in-file with **Options.ReverseDirection 1**

### Significant Changes:
* Change: Alter default object optimisation settings, to allow some X objects to work better.
* New: Add _experimental_ IRawRuntime interface for train plugins. This allows plugins to recieve raw keyboard / mouse input data from the sim.
* New: Add option to allow routefiles to be constructed in the reverse direction. This is _experimental_ and signalling / other trains may not work as expected.
* New: Allow touch elements to define a custom cursor.
* Fix: Crash if switching directly to a POI camera from the cabview.
* Fix: Anisotropic filtering could get stuck off.
