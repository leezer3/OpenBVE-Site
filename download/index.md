# Nightly Builds:

Nightly builds are available from this address:

These provide a daily snapshot, which is automatically built from the current source whenever a change is made.
Whilst they are generally stable, it's important to remember that sometimes things may not work quite right. 

If this is the case, please let us know by posting on the forum or opening an issue on GitHub, and we'll try and get to the bottom of it.
